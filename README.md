# Muon Lab Utilites

The main goal of this project is to maintain organization for the uw g-2 group.  We should add general utilities to this repository and they can be install system wide on multiple computers.  Currently there is only python code, but I anticipate the possibility of a c++ library as well.

## New Python Code

Add a new python class/module to the contents of files in <project-home>/py/muonlab/.
